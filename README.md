This repository contains an illustration of the numerical experiments performed in the paper entitled
"[*Multiple Testing and Variable Selection along Least Angle Regression's path*](https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.12072)" by Jean-Marc AzaÃ¯s and [Yohann De Castro](https:ydecastro.github.io).

[Download file on the ArXiv (arXiv:1906.12072)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.12072)

## Python source code

The Python code can be downloaded at

[Github repository lar_testing](https://github.com/ydecastro/lar_testing)

The file **multiple_spacing_tests.py** contains all the auxiliary functions, that is the *MAIN FILE*. The main features of our code are presented in **Law_LAR.ipynb**.


The file **FDR_control.py** is specific to the FDR control and it is illustrated in the notebook 'multiple_spacing_tests.ipynb'. The others .txt files are datasets on HIV drug resistance.

It requires at most: python>=3.6.4, numpy>=1.14.0, scipy>=1.0.0

## Getting started

Python notebook on a new testing procedure on the LAR path and a new FDR control using LAR.

Please [Have a look at the Jupiter notebook on blob for the JOINT LAW](https://github.com/ydecastro/lar_testing/blob/master/law_LAR.ipynb)
