This repository contains an illustration of the numerical experiments performed in the paper entitled
"[*Multiple Testing and Variable Selection along Least Angle Regression's path*](https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.12072)" by Jean-Marc Aza√Øs and [Yohann De Castro](https:ydecastro.github.io).

[Download file on the ArXiv (arXiv:1906.12072)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.12072)

## Python source code

The Python code can be downloaded at

## Getting started

Python notebook on a new testing procedure on the LAR path and a new FDR control using LAR.

Please [Have a look at the Jupiter notebook on blob for the JOINT LAW](https://github.com/ydecastro/lar_testing/blob/master/Law_LAR.ipynb)

Please [Have a look at the Jupiter notebook on blob for FDR](https://github.com/ydecastro/lar_testing/blob/master/multiple_spacing_tests.ipynb)
